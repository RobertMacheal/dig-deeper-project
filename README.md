# dig-deeper-project
Repository for Cranfield University's Applied Bioinformatics soil microbiome group project, studying soil communities in restored grassland

This project analyses 16S and ITS amplicon data obtained from soil samples to determine how ecosystem restoration affects microbial and fungal communities. This is a group project for Cranfield University's MSc in Applied Bioinformatics 2024/2025 with the data supplied by the Restoring Resilient Ecosystems (RestREco) project.

The repository includes:
- Scripts from the 16S and ITS analysis pipeline
- Code from a results visualisation tool
